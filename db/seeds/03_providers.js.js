I bring decades of experience, an arsenal of creative tactics and shrewd judgment to every case. Dismissal is always the first goal I strive for. While an aggressive approach may be necessary, depending on the circumstances of your case, it is not always the best approach. A creatively executed defense or skillful negotiation can sometimes achieve superior results. When the situation calls for it, however, I am a fierce advocate in trial and will fight to the bitter end when it is in your best interests. Above all, I am a results-oriented criminal defense lawyer and litigator, and will seek the best possible outcome under the circumstances of your case and situation, whether it is a plea agreement that reduces the potential consequences, a dismissal or acquittal at trial. I have found that the key to success in any criminal defense case is thorough preparation. The government has the burden of proving every part of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. When your defense lawyer conducts a complete investigation and fully analyzes the facts and legal issues in your case, this burden becomes much heavier for the government to prove.
