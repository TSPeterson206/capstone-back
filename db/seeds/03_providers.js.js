With locations in Bellevue and Everett, I have provided exceptional legal representation for people throughout Washington facing serious criminal accusations for more than 26 years. Whether you have been charged with DUI, assault, domestic violence or some other allegation, I recognize how much is at stake in your case, and I will work tirelessly on your behalf to protect your rights and preserve your freedom. I bring decades of experience, an arsenal of creative tactics and shrewd judgment to every case. Dismissal is always the first goal I strive for. While an aggressive approach may be necessary, depending on the circumstances of your case, it is not always the best approach. A creatively executed defense or skillful negotiation can sometimes achieve superior results. When the situation calls for it, however, I am a fierce advocate in trial and will fight to the bitter end when it is in your best interests. Above all, I am a results-oriented criminal defense lawyer and litigator, and will seek the best possible outcome under the circumstances of your case and situation, whether it is a plea agreement that reduces the potential consequences, a dismissal or acquittal at trial. I have found that the key to success in any criminal defense case is thorough preparation. The government has the burden of proving every part of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. When your defense lawyer conducts a complete investigation and fully analyzes the facts and legal issues in your case, this burden becomes much heavier for the government to prove.
